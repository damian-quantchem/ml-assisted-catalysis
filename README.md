# Machine Learning–Assisted Catalysis

This repository explores the application of **machine learning techniques**
to catalytic systems, with the goal of accelerating catalyst screening
and improving reaction property prediction.

The work reflects research practices used in modern computational
chemistry and catalysis studies.

## Scientific Motivation

Catalytic performance depends on complex relationships between
structure, composition, and reaction environment.
Machine learning provides a data-driven approach to:

- Identify trends across catalyst families
- Predict adsorption energies and reaction barriers
- Reduce the cost of exhaustive quantum chemical calculations
- Support hypothesis generation for catalytic mechanisms

## Methods

Typical workflows include:

- Feature extraction from chemical and structural descriptors
- Supervised learning models for regression and classification
- Model validation using cross-validation and error metrics
- Comparison of ML predictions against DFT reference data

---

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- NumPy, pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Example Applications

- Catalyst activity screening
- Selectivity prediction between competing pathways
- Trend analysis across transition-metal catalysts
- Support for AI-assisted catalyst discovery
